# ERP Quality Module - Data Sets

This directory contains the datasets used for training and evaluating the AI models in the ERP Quality Module.

## Directory Structure

- `raw/` - Raw, unprocessed datasets
- `processed/` - Cleaned and preprocessed datasets ready for model training

## Available Datasets
